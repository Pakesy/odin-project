            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Today’s recipe is more of a technique than a recipe – but it’s one that all steak lovers should know
                because it’s easy, worthy of using on high quality steaks and also a way to really elevate economical
                steaks.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Steak</li>
                    <li>Butter</li>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <div class="recipe-section">
                <ol>
                    <li>Bring to room temp! This makes an amazing difference to cooking through evenly rather than
                        ending up with a thick overcooked band in order for the very centre to be cooked to your liking;
                    </li>
                    <li>Pat dry and season the steak generously with salt and pepper – this helps form that amazing
                        crust we all know and love about great steaks.</li>
                    <li>Get your skillet <strong>SMOKING HOT</strong> before putting the steak in – again, for the crust.</li>
                    <li><strong>Warning:</strong> The butter will sputter when you add the thyme, so stand back!</li>
                    <li>Take the steak off the stove BEFORE your desired internal temperature (see chart below) because
                        the internal temperature will continue to rise as it rests.</li>
                    <li><strong>REST</strong> your steak for 5 to 10 minutes so it sucks its own juices back in and the fibres relax.
                        This is a must-do step for any protein you cook hard and fast!</li>
                </ol>
