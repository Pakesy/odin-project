# Landing Page Website

This is a fake website i made as a part of the Odin Project curriculum.

The task was to recreate [this](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/main/foundations/html_css/project/odin-project.png
) landing page, while using [these](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/main/foundations/html_css/project/colors_and_stuff.png) assets.

Didnt make the site responsive and stuck to the minimum requirements of the brief, trying to finish as many of these as i can while on UNI break.
